# Publications Manager

**Version:** 2.3.2  
**Author:** Ntamadakis  
**License:** GPL v2 or later

A modern WordPress plugin for managing academic publications with automatic author-to-team member linking and advanced page builder support. Designed for research institutions, academic departments, and individual researchers.

## Key Features

### 📚 Publication Management

- **Custom Post Type**: Dedicated "Publications" post type with full WordPress integration
- **24 Publication Types**: Journal articles, books, conference papers, theses, and more
- **Author Taxonomy**: Authors stored as custom taxonomy (`pm_author`) for:
  - Better querying and filtering
  - Seamless page builder integration
  - Individual author pages/archives
  - Term meta for team member links
- **Rich Metadata**: DOI, journal, volume, pages, publisher, abstract, ISBN, ISSN, keywords, and more
- **Automatic Year Extraction**: Publication year automatically extracted from post date

### 👥 Team Member Integration

The plugin's standout feature is **bidirectional linking between authors and team members**:

- **Author Taxonomy**: Each author is a reusable taxonomy term
- **Manual Linking**: Link author terms to team members via the Authors taxonomy admin
- **Bidirectional Relationships**:
  - Authors link to team member profiles
  - Team member pages show all their publications
- **Bricks Builder Ready**: Full integration via custom fields and query loops

**How it works:**

1. Configure your Team CPT slug in Publications → Tools
2. Create publications with authors (authors are saved as taxonomy terms)
3. In Publications → Authors, link each author term to a team member
4. Author names automatically become clickable links to team member pages
5. Team member pages show their publications via Bricks query loops

### 🎨 Bricks Builder Integration

Full integration with Bricks Builder for maximum design flexibility:

**Dynamic Fields Available:**

- `{post_meta:pm_type}` - Formatted publication type (e.g., "Journal Article")

- `{term_meta:pm_author_team_url}` - Team member URL for an author term
- All publication meta fields (pm_doi, pm_journal, pm_volume, etc.)

**Query Loops:**

- Team member pages automatically show their publications
- Filter by publication type, year, or author
- Full support for Bricks' dynamic data system

### 🌐 Crossref Import

## Bricks Builder Usage

### Display Authors with Links

In any Bricks element:

```
{post_meta:pm_authors}
```

Output: `<a href="/team/john-smith">John Smith</a>, Jane Doe`

### Get Author Term URL

When looping through author terms:

```
{term_meta:pm_author_team_url}
```

Returns the team member permalink for the current author.

### Display Publication Fields

All fields available as dynamic data:

- `{post_meta:pm_type}` - Formatted type name
- `{post_meta:pm_doi}` - DOI
- `{post_meta:pm_journal}` - Journal name
- `{post_meta:pm_volume}` - Volume
- `{post_meta:pm_pages}` - Pages
- `{post_meta:pm_year}` - Year
- `{post_meta:pm_abstract}` - Abstract

### Team Member Publications

On team member single pages, create a query loop for publications - the plugin automatically filters to show only that team member's publications.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I set up team member linking?**
A: Add a custom field `pm_name_variations` to each team member with comma-separated name variations. The plugin handles the rest automatically.

**Q: Can I use a different team member post type?**
A: Yes! Go to Publications > Settings and change the team member CPT slug.

**Q: Why don't authors link automatically?**
A: Make sure the author name in the publication exactly matches one of the name variations in the team member's `pm_name_variations` field.

**Q: Can I use this with Elementor/other page builders?**
A: Yes, all fields are registered for REST API. Bricks Builder has dedicated integration. Other builders should work with dynamic fields.

**Q: Can I migrate from teachPress?**
A: A migration tool would need to be developed. The fields are compatible, but the storage structure is different.

**Q: Does it work with Gutenberg?**
A: The publication post type uses the classic editor for better control over meta fields.

**Q: How do I display publications on my site?**
A: Use Bricks Builder (recommended) or create custom templates using the helper functions and shortcodes.

## About

### Author & Development

**Publications Manager** is developed by **Ntamadakis** as part of the [ntamadakis.gr](https://ntamadakis.gr) program - a collection of WordPress tools and plugins designed for academic institutions and research organizations.

The ntamadakis.gr program focuses on creating practical, well-architected WordPress solutions that bridge the gap between academic needs and modern web development practices.

### Support the Project

If you find this plugin useful, please consider supporting its development:

**[Support Me](https://ntamadakis.gr/support-me)** ☕

Your support helps maintain and improve this plugin, add new features, and develop more tools for the WordPress academic community.

## Credits & Inspiration

This plugin is **inspired by the excellent [teachPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/teachpress/)** plugin by Michael Winkler.

**teachPress** has been the go-to solution for academic publication management in WordPress for many years. Publications Manager takes a different architectural approach (Custom Post Types vs. custom tables) while maintaining compatibility with teachPress's comprehensive field structure and publication types.

### Key Differences from teachPress

While teachPress focuses on simplicity and standalone functionality, Publications Manager focuses on:

- Deep integration with modern page builders
- Team member relationship management
- WordPress-native architecture
- Advanced admin filtering and sorting

Both plugins are excellent choices depending on your specific needs. See the comparison section above for details.
